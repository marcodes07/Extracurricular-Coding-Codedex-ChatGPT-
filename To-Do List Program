# Let's make a To-Do List Manager
# This will teach you loops, lists (to store tasks), conditionals (for menu choices), and functions (so your code is neat and reusable)
# A menu is a list of choices the user can see so they know what the program can do
# It's the perfect stepping stone before graphics, GUIs, and GIFs
# This program will let the user: add tasks, view all tasks, remove tasks and quit
# ^^^ The tasks the program can perform are a part of the menu 
# We’ll keep a list in Python that stores all the tasks
# We’ll use a loop so the menu keeps showing until the user chooses “Quit"
# Each menu option will be handled with an if/elif/else.

# Let's get started with the code then! 
# ChatGPT gave me blanks so the whole code is written by me and it.
# From lime 32, I pretty much wrote it myself. 

tasks = [] #start with an empty list 

while True: # this makes the loop continuous until the user quits
    print("\nTo-Do List Manager")
    print("1. Add Task")
    print("2. View Tasks")
    print("3. Remove Task")
    print("4. Quit")
    
    choice = input("Choose an option (1-4):  ")

    if choice == "1": 
       # TODO: get a task from the user and add it to the list 
        task = input("Please enter a new task:  ")
        tasks.append(task) # Append is a method to put something at the end of/in a list 
        print("Task added!")
    
    elif choice == "2": # using elif instead of making 4 separate if loops
         if not tasks: 
             print("No tasks yet!")
         else: 
             for index, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1): # enumerate displays all the tasks out by their number eg. 1. do hw 2. laundry etc. 
                print(index,task)
                
    elif choice == "3":
        if not tasks: print("No tasks to remove!")
        else: 
            for index, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1): # for loop goes thru all the tasks
                print(index,task)
                
            remove_index = int(input("Whcih task would you like to remove?  "))
            tasks.pop(remove_index - 1) # pop is a function that removes elements
            print("Task removed! ")
            
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break # break quits the loop and thus the program stops
