# Spin on the To-Do List Manager 
# Let's make a calculator! The functions of this basic calculator include +, -, * and /. 
# This calculator will also be able to show the results in float format, which means decimal values are supported
# We start off with a menu, just like our to-do list manager. It helps the user choose which function they want the calculator to perform. 

# Let's get started with the code then! 
# ChatGPT merely is ASSISTING me. No blanks, no code. I'm using my brain for this one

tasks = [] # start with empty task list just like to do list menu
