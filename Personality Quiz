# this is a personality quiz program 
# there will be multiple questuons asked and at the end you will get your result
# We will need:
# Variables to keep score for every personality type for Example: extrovert_score = 0, introvert_score = 0
# Multiple questions: each ansswer adds to the score Example: extrovert_score += 1, introvert_score += 1
# Final comparison at the end -> whichever score is higher = the result
